# WezTerm

## Notes
- Uses the Catppuccin Frappe colorscheme with a modified background color.
- Has some opinionated choices such as enabling scrollbar and disabling the new tab button.

## My personal bindings.
- `CTRL+SHIFT+h/v` - Horizontal/Veritcal splits on the current pane.
- `CTRL+SHIFT+w` - Close current pane.
- `CTRL+SHIFT+c` - Clear the current view.
- `CTRL+ALT+h/j/k/l` - Resize current pane (uses vim bindings).
